1a. Let's call the number of solutions for $n$ seating positions arranged in a straight line as $S(n)$. In any such solution, either the $n$th seat is chosen or not. The number of solutions for the latter case is $S(n - 1)$, and that for the former case is $S(n - 2)$ (because when the $n$th seat is chosen, the $(n - 1)$th seat cannot be). Thus, $S(n) = S(n - 1) + S(n - 2)$. For the base case, we can easily see that $S(0) = 1$ (because the act of not choosing anything is itself a solution) and $S(1) = 2$ (because we can either choose the only seat or not). Thus, we see that $S(n)$ has the same recurrence as $F(n)$, the Fibonacci sequence, but $S(0) = F(1)$ and $S(1) = F(2)$. Therefore, by induction, $S(n) = F(n + 1)$. This concludes the proof.

1b. Let's call the number of solutions for $n$ seating positions arranged in a circle as $T(n)$. We can see that almost any solution the problem where seats are arranged in a straight line can be a solution to the case where the seats are arranged in a circle. The only cases we must exclude are those where seat $1$ and seat $n$ are both chosen. For $n >= 4$, the number of such cases is $S(n - 4)$, since both $1$ and $n$ are chosen, neither seat $2$ nor seat $n - 1$ can be. So, the number of solutions for $n$ seats arranged in a circle is simply $S(n) - S(n - 4) = F(n + 1) - F(n - 3) = F(n) + F(n - 1) - F(n - 3) = F(n) + F(n - 2)$. For the cases $n = 3$ and $n = 2$, we can manually verify that this equation holds. This concludes the proof.

2a. Consider the two expressions $F_n^2 - F_{n + 1}F_{n - 1}$ and one of similar form obtained by replacing $n$ with $n - 1$, $F_{n - 1}^2 - F_nF_{n - 2}$. We will first prove that these two terms add to $0$.

\begin{align*}
    F_n^2 &- F_{n + 1}F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 1}^2 &- F_nF_{n - 2} \\
    F_n^2 &- F_{n - 1}(F_{n + 1} - F_{n - 1}) &- F_nF_{n - 2} \\
    F_n^2 &- F_{n - 1}F_n &- F_nF_{n - 2} \\
    &F_n(F_n - F_{n - 1}) &- F_nF_{n - 2} \\
    &F_nF_{n - 2} &- F_nF_{n - 2} \\
    0
\end{align*}

Thus, such expressions have the same magnitude but alternate signs each step along the way (from $n = 0$ onwards). We can check the base case value of $F_1^2 - F_2F_0 = -1$ to infer that $F_n^2 - F_{n + 1}F_{n - 1} = (-1)^n$. This concludes the proof.

2b. This one can be derived by repeated application of the recursive definition of the Fibonacci series.

\begin{align*}
    F_{n + 2} &= F_n + F_{n + 1} & \\
    F_{n + 2} &= F_n + F_{n - 1} + F_n \\
    F_{n + 2} &= F_n + F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2} + F_{n - 1} \\
    \cdots \\
    F_{n + 2} &= \sum_{i = n}^0F_i + F_1
\end{align*}

This concludes the proof.

2c. We can easily see that $F_2 = F_0^2 + F_1^2 = 2$ and $F_3 = F_1(F_0 + F_2) = 3$. Assume that the given equations are true for up to $2n + 1$. Then, we can derive the following for $F_{2n + 2}$ and $F_{2n + 3}$.

\begin{align*}
    F_{2n + 2} &= F_{2n} + F_{2n + 1} \\
    F_{2n + 2} &= F_{n - 1}^2 + F_n^2 + F_n(F_{n - 1} + F_{n + 1}) \\
    F_{2n + 2} &= F_{n - 1}^2 + F_n(F_n + F_{n - 1} + F_{n + 1}) \\
    F_{2n + 2} &= F_{n - 1}^2 + F_n(2F_{n + 1}) \\
    F_{2n + 2} &= (F_{n + 1} - F_n)^2 - 2F_nF_{n + 1} \\
    F_{2n + 2} &= F_n^2 + F_{n + 1}^2
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    F_{2n + 3} &= F_{2n + 1} + F_{2n + 2} \\
    F_{2n + 3} &= F_n(F_{n - 1} + F_{n + 1}) + F_n^2 + F_{n + 1}^2 \\
    F_{2n + 3} &= F_n(F_{n - 1} + F_{n + 1} + F_n) + F_{n + 1}^2 \\
    F_{2n + 3} &= F_n(2F_{n + 1}) + F_{n + 1}^2 \\
    F_{2n + 3} &= F_{n + 1}(2F_n + F_{n + 1}) \\
    F_{2n + 3} &= F_{n + 1}(F_n + F_{n + 2}) \\
\end{align*}

This concludes the proof by induction.
